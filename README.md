Solving the Problem Statement alloted for image classification of CCD and Non CCD Artifacts.

CRISMIS.ipynb contains Step 1 of the problem statement that is taking in input the URL and printing the image corresponding to the same.

new_dataset.ipynb downloads the .IMG files from the directory whose url we are provided with and coverts them to .png format.

Image classification ML Model classifies the images accordingly whether they are a CCD Artifact or notsed on CNN model.

The dataset comprises of manually labelled CCD and non-CCD Artifacts for both test and training.
